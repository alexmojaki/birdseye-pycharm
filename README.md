- [Documentation](https://birdseye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations.html#basic-usage)

[birdseye](https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye) is a unique debugger for Python. This plugin lets you use it right in the code editor of your Intellij IDE, so that you can switch between editing and debugging seamlessly:

By default the plugin also runs the birdseye server for you, although you can configure it for total freedom.

You can switch between using the plugin and the normal browser UI for birdseye without any additional effort; both use the same database and server.
